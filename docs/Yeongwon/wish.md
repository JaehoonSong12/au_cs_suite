# Project Bid
This project is more than just a photo booth; it is 'Yeongwon's' first foray into delivering new experiences and values.

Starting at Auburn University, this project presents a crucial opportunity to provide users with unique memories while simultaneously showcasing our vision and brand values. Yeongwon's program will captivate the interest of students and the local community through distinctive features and aesthetic design that set it apart from traditional photo booths. 

Our goal is not merely to create a machine but to offer unforgettable moments that generate a positive cycle of social contribution and revenue.

## Vision Statement
Yeongwon aims to revolutionize the photo shooting market with innovative technology and design, beginning at Auburn University. Our vision includes:

- **Unique Concept**: Incorporating "moving pictures" akin to those in Harry Potter's animated newspapers, providing special experiences through customizable themes for graduation and school events, and enhancing the atmosphere with music video recording features and lighting/sound effects.

- **User-Friendly Interface (UI/UX)**: An interface that allows easy shooting, editing, and downloading. After shooting, a QR code for downloading digital files and sharing on social media like Instagram and TikTok is generated.

- **Community Growth**: A portion of the profits will be donated to scholarships at Auburn University, fostering growth with the community and building a sustainable growth model based on the support of students and locals.

- **Long-term Goals**: Successfully complete the initial project and expand to major universities across the USA, eventually developing our own technology based on the expertise gained from initial subcontractors.

## Technical Information

### Functional Requirements: Frontend
- **User Interface (UI/UX)**: Intuitive screen layout offering theme selection, filter application, and preview capabilities, including AR filters and video options.
- **User Experience (UX)**: Immediate digital file download via QR code after shooting, integration with social media platforms, and real-time preview and simple editing options during shooting.

### Functional Requirements: Backend
- **Program Functions**: User data storage and management (e.g., shooting records, theme selections), real-time server connections for updates and maintenance, and cloud-based data management for stability and efficiency.
- **Payment and Management System**: Integration of payment systems (credit card, mobile payment), automated revenue data compilation for monthly reports, and immediate remote server-based updates and maintenance requests.
- **Security and Data Protection**: Encryption of user data for protection and prevention of data leakage of photos and videos.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Reliability and Stability**: Designed for long-term stable operation of programs and devices, with maintenance contracts for emergency responses in the first year.
- **Scalability**: Modular design considering expansion to other universities, with a flexible structure for easy addition of new features and updates.
- **User Convenience**: Fast and intuitive user experience, with an interface that all age groups can easily use.
- **Efficiency**: Minimization of electricity consumption per machine to reduce costs and automatic calculation of film usage for optimal cost management.
- **Distinctive Features**: Moving beyond the basic features of traditional photo booths to provide new shooting experiences and outcomes, creating additional revenue models through advanced features and user-selectable options.

## Conclusion
This project is not just about developing a product; it marks the first step in making Yeongwon a leader in new shooting cultures and social contributions. We are confident that the successful implementation at Auburn University will establish Yeongwon as a leader in the industry.

We look forward to taking this first step together, carrying forward Yeongwon's vision and passion in this project.
