The **Global Photo Booth** (GPB), also known as *Snap & Share*, offers a fun and accessible photo booth experience for users worldwide. It combines mobile technology, customizable photo features, and local collaborations, enabling users to capture and share moments easily. Core features include QR codes for direct access, in-store booths, and a mobile-friendly web app. By partnering with local events and personalities, the service also provides unique photo frames and themes to engage different communities.



## System Architecture

The GPB system is built on a **client-server architecture** that separates the roles of the frontend and backend for better organization and future scalability. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the system's key components:

- **Frontend:** A React-powered responsive web client that works on multiple devices without requiring any software installation.  
- **Backend:** A Python-powered server responsible for handling file storage, photo editing, and metadata management.  
- **Cloud Storage:** Photos and session data are stored on scalable platforms like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud.  
- **QR Code Integration:** Unique QR codes link users directly to their photo sessions.

This architecture ensures that users have a consistent and efficient experience while making it easy to maintain and expand the system.


### Instructions: Frontend (React)

The GPB frontend is powered by Node.js and is designed to handle all client-side responsibilities. Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend:

1. **Ensure Node.js and NPM are Installed**  
   The script checks for the required packages, including `web-vitals`, `axios`, and `tailwindcss`. If any of these packages are missing, they will be installed automatically.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Check and install the required dependencies using npm:
```bash
# Check if web-vitals is installed
if ! npm list web-vitals > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  npm install web-vitals                            # Performance monitoring
fi

# Check if axios is installed
if ! npm list axios > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  npm install axios                                 # HTTP requests
fi

# Check if tailwindcss is installed
if ! npm list tailwindcss > /dev/null 2>&1; then
  npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer   # CSS Styling framework
  npx tailwindcss init
fi
```

3. **Build the Frontend**  
   Install all the required npm packages and build the project:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
4. **Run the Frontend**  
   Start the frontend server using npm:
```bash
npm start
```

By following these steps, the GPB frontend can be configured, built, and executed to support the system's user interface (frontend functional requirements).


### Instructions: Backend (Python)

The GPB backend is powered by Python and is designed to handle all server-side responsibilities. Follow these steps to set up and run the backend:

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**  
   The script checks for `python3` or `python`. If neither is installed, you will need to install Python before proceeding.

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Required tools and libraries, including `poetry`, `tox`, and `pipreqs`, are automatically checked and installed if missing:
```bash
if command -v python3 &>/dev/null; then
    PYTHON_CMD=python3
    PIP_CMD=pip3
elif command -v python &>/dev/null; then
    PYTHON_CMD=python
    PIP_CMD=pip
else
    echo -e "\033[0;33Python is not installed. Please install Python and try again.\033[0m"
    exit 1
fi

if ! command -v poetry &>/dev/null; then
    echo -e "\033[0;33mpoetry is not installed. Installing...\033[0m"
    $PIP_CMD install poetry
fi

if ! command -v tox &>/dev/null; then
    echo -e "\033[0;33mtox is not installed. Installing...\033[0m"
    $PIP_CMD install tox
fi

if ! command -v pipreqs &>/dev/null; then
    echo -e "\033[0;33mpipreqs is not installed. Installing...\033[0m"
    $PIP_CMD install pipreqs
fi
```

3. **Initialize the Environment**  
   Generate dependencies, manage them with `poetry`, and install additional tools:
```bash
pipreqs . --ignore "ext/" --force    # Generate dependencies
poetry add $(cat requirements.txt)   # Add dependencies to Poetry
poetry run pip install python-multipart
rm requirements.txt                  # Clean up
```

4. **Build the Backend**  
   Compile the backend into a distributable format using `poetry` and `pyinstaller`:
```bash
poetry build
poetry run pyinstaller --onefile cli.py
```

5. **Run the Server**  
   Start the backend server using standalone-executable in `dist/cli`. Optionally, start the backend server using `poetry`:
```bash
poetry run cli_gpb_server
```

By following these steps, the GPB backend can be configured, built, and executed to support the system's backend functionalities.

## Programming Language, Libraries, and Framework

To ensure the Global Photo Booth (GPB) system is both reliable and efficient, we have carefully selected a variety of tools and libraries to handle the different components of the backend and frontend. Each choice was made with the goal of maintaining flexibility, scalability, and ease of use for both developers and end-users.

The core technologies for development are chosen as follows.

- **Python** is used for the *backend* because it is well-suited for handling files, processing images, and managing data.
- **JavaScript**, along with **HTML** and **CSS**, is used for creating the web-based *frontend* interface.

### Backend: API Management
For the backend, effective communication between the frontend and the server is critical. To achieve this, we use the following tools:

- **FastAPI**: A lightweight and fast framework for building RESTful APIs. It allows for seamless interaction between the backend and the frontend, ensuring responsive and efficient data exchange.
