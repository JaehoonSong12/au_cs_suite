# AU-CS Collaborative Suite

## About
The AU-CS Collaborative Suite is a repository of diverse microservices and applications developed iteratively by a team of computer science students from Auburn University, guided by a Georgia Tech senior CS developer. This project emphasizes designing architectures that structure applications as a set of independently deployable, loosely coupled components, also known as services. These microservices foster scalability, modularity, and ease of maintenance.

## Features
- **Microservice Architecture**: Applications are structured as independent, deployable components to ensure flexibility and scalability.
- **Iterative Development**: Continuous improvement through regular development cycles.
- **Collaboration Focus**: Team-oriented workflows using GitHub for version control, issue tracking, and collaborative coding.
- **Diverse Applications**: A range of services addressing different use cases, unified under a shared repository.

## Development Approach
1. **Iterative Cycles**: Development occurs in sprints, with each cycle refining functionality and addressing feedback.
2. **Service Modularity**: Each microservice is self-contained, facilitating independent deployment and updates.
3. **Collaboration and Learning**: Encouraging mentorship, code reviews, and shared learning among the team.

## Repository Structure
```plaintext
/microservice-1
    /src
    /tests
/microservice-2

README.md
```

Each microservice has its own directory with source code (`/src`) and tests (`/tests`). Additional documentation for each service can be found within its respective folder.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/au-cs-collaborative-suite.git
   cd au-cs-collaborative-suite
   ```
2. **Navigate to a Microservice Directory**
   ```bash
   cd microservice-1
   ```
3. **Run the Service**
   Refer to the specific microservice documentation for setup and execution instructions.
