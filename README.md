# AU-CS Suite

## About
This is a repository of diverse microservices and applications developed iteratively by a team of computer science students from Auburn University, guided by a Georgia Tech senior CS developer. This project emphasizes designing architectures that structure applications as a set of independently deployable, loosely coupled components, also known as services. These microservices foster scalability, modularity, and ease of maintenance.

## Features
- **Microservice Architecture**: Applications are structured as independent, deployable components to ensure flexibility and scalability.
- **Iterative Development**: Continuous improvement through regular development cycles.
- **Collaboration Focus**: Team-oriented workflows using GitHub for version control, issue tracking, and collaborative coding.
- **Diverse Applications**: A range of services addressing different use cases, unified under a shared repository.

## Development Approach
1. **Iterative Cycles**: Development occurs in sprints, with each cycle refining functionality and addressing feedback.
2. **Service Modularity**: Each microservice is self-contained, facilitating independent deployment and updates.
3. **Collaboration and Learning**: Encouraging mentorship, code reviews, and shared learning among the team.

The repository uses a Gradle-style directory structure. Each language-specific folder under `src` can have its own execution points, such as `cli` for command-line interfaces and `gui` for graphical user interfaces. Testing directories for each language are located under `tests`.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/au-cs-suite.git
   cd au-cs-suite
   ```
2. **Navigate to a Language or Execution Point**
   ```bash
   cd src/language-1/cli
   ```
3. **Run the Service**
   Refer to the specific microservice documentation for setup and execution instructions.

## Contributing
